# Path Patching & Activation Patching

This repo contains my implementation of **path patching**. Eventually I'll add it to TransformerLens as a demo, but for now I just wanted to add it as a personal repo. I expect it to be useful for the research sprint I'm about to start for Neel Nanda's SERI MATS stream.

See [this Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/15CJ1WAf8AWm6emI3t2nVfnO85-hxwyJU#scrollTo=jghm1tNqX2_i) for a demo.
